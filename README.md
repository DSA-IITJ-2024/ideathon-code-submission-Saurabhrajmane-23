File compression using Huffman encoding is a fundamental technique in data compression, renowned for its simplicity and effectiveness. Huffman encoding assigns variable-length codes to input symbols based on their frequencies, with more frequent symbols represented by shorter codes. This method efficiently reduces the size of files by replacing commonly occurring symbols with shorter codes and less frequent symbols with longer codes, resulting in overall space savings. Despite its straightforward implementation, Huffman encoding achieves impressive compression ratios, making it a widely used algorithm in various applications, including text and image compression.
